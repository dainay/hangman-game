# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game, a word guessing game in a digital format. This project allows users to guess letters of a hidden word, with each incorrect guess bringing them closer to losing the game (and potentially their virtual life). Have fun!

## Demo

## How to Play Locally

1. **Start the Game:** Load the game, and a random word will be fetched for you to guess.
2. **Guess Letters:** Click on letters from the virtual keyboard to guess the word.
3. **Use Hints (Optional):** Stuck on a guess? Use a hint. Be cautious, thoughâ€”it will count as an error.
4. **Win/Lose:** The game ends when you successfully guess the word or run out of guesses.
5. **Restart:** After a game concludes, click "Try Again" to start a new game.
